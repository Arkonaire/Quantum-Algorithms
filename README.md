# Quantum-Algorithms
Implementation of a collection of quantum algorithms using qiskit.
Objectives:
1) To familiarize myself with qiskit and related tools for quantum algorithm design and simulation in Python
2) To compile a comprehensive list of the major quantum algorithms and protocols that I am familiar with

Next steps:
1) Grover's Algorithm
2) Linear Systems
3) VQE
4) QAOA
5) RSA Eavesdropping
6) Quantum Error Correction
7) Quantum State Tomography
8) Communication Protocols

# Quantum-Algorithms
Implementation of a collection of quantum algorithms using qiskit.
Objectives:
1) To familiarize myself with qiskit and related tools for quantum algorithm design and simulation in Python
2) To compile a comprehensive list of the major quantum algorithms and protocols that I am familiar with

Next steps:
1) Quantum Error Correction
2) Quantum State Tomography
3) RSA Eavesdropping
4) Linear Systems - HHL Algorithm
5) Variational Quantum Eigensolver
6) Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm

# Quantum-Algorithms
Implementation of a collection of quantum algorithms using qiskit.
Objectives:
1) To familiarize myself with qiskit and related tools for quantum algorithm design and simulation in Python
2) To compile a comprehensive list of the major quantum algorithms and protocols that I am familiar with

Next steps:
1) Linear Systems
2) VQE
3) QAOA
4) RSA Eavesdropping
5) Quantum Error Correction
6) Quantum State Tomography
7) Communication Protocols

# Quantum-Algorithms
Implementation of a collection of quantum algorithms using qiskit.
Objectives:
1) To familiarize myself with qiskit and related tools for quantum algorithm design and simulation in Python
2) To compile a comprehensive list of the major quantum algorithms that I am familiar with

Next steps:
1) RSA Eavesdropping
2) Grover's Algorithm
3) 5-Qbit Error Correction
4) Quantum State Tomography
5) Linear Systems
6) VQE
7) QAOA
